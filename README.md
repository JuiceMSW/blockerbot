## User guide

Sites can be blocked in two ways. By clicking on the extension icon in the toolbar and selecting "Block this Site", you can automatically add the URL of the site you're on to the blocked list. You can also add sites one after another by selecting "Manage Block List", entering a full URL in, and pressing submit. You can also view and remove sites from your blocked list on this page.

If you want to block an entire domain, simply add the domain to the blocked list using either of the two methods. For example, blocking "https://www.reddit.com" will also block "https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor", but blocking "https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor" will not block "https://www.reddit.com".
